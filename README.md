- The HTML? Coded by GPT-3/4
- The CSS? Coded by GPT-3/4
- The JS? Programmed by GPT-3
- The text? Written by GPT-4
- The translations? Performed by GPT-4
- The images? Rendered by DALL-E

As for the articles, minimal input was given; only a basic task consisting of the article's topic or a quote to include. The creative brain behind the articles on this website is GPT-4 in the form of Bing Chat.

As for the article titles/images, they are all derived from their respective articles. The initial author bio was made using minimal input, and any further author bios/images were then derived from the most recently generated bios.

As for the design of the website, the main design choices were all created using minimum input, meaning only the purpose of the website was shared. For anything that didn't look or work right, I told GPT-3/4 what was wrong and let it make the fixes or improvements itself.

The website logo and background image were however edited by me after generating them using DALL-E, as DALL-E is far from ideal for this use case and produced poor results. I could have learned to use a better image creation solution, but that would require a decent time investment that I currently do not want to make.

<sub> GPT-3 refers to ChatGPT. GPT-4 refers to Bing Chat. DALL-E refers to Bing Create. </sub>
